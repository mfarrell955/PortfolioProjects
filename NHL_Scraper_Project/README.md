#NHL_Scraper_Project

In this project, I built a web scraper following instructions from @Action_Backers on YouTube to collect data on all 32 NHL teams for the 2021-2022 regular season.

I also collected individual player data from https://www.naturalstattrick.com/ for the same season.

This data was then cleaned in both Excel and Microsoft PowerBI as needed and used to create a visualization on NHL 5v5 Offense, analyzing both teams and players.
